<h2>Who is Jesus Christ?</h2>
<p>Based on the redemption history narrated in the Bible. Jesus Christ is the only son of the God sent to our world. He was made human beings and died on the cross so that all our sins can be forgiven and so that we can be in communion with God, the father again.</p>
<p>The picture shown abpve is not a picture of Jesus Christ but is actually an image that kind of traces or shows how much pain Jesus Christ went through so that we can be redeemed.What he did is not something human being will want to experience. we heard of Martyr and people dying for their nation or a person but he actually did it for the whole  world so that who ever believe in him may not perish but actually have eternal life. He is the hero of all the time.</p>
